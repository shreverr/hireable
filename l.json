{
  "overallScore": 6,
  "summary": "The candidate's LeetCode profile is extremely weak and shows a significant mismatch with the job requirements. With only 4 problems solved, all in Java and dating back to 2015, the profile demonstrates a beginner-level understanding of a very narrow set of topics and a complete lack of recent activity or proficiency in the required JavaScript language.",
  "problemSolvingAbility": {
    "score": 5,
    "analysis": "The candidate has solved only 4 problems in total (1 Easy, 2 Medium, 1 Hard). This volume is insufficient to demonstrate the intermediate-level problem-solving skills required for building production-grade systems. The extremely low ranking (5,000,001) confirms a novice skill level."
  },
  "dsaKnowledge": {
    "score": 10,
    "analysis": "Knowledge appears limited to basic tree traversal algorithms (DFS, BFS). While this shows foundational knowledge in one area, it falls far short of the 'strong grasp of data structures' required. There is no evidence of experience with algorithms for Time-Series Data Analysis or Real-time Data Processing, which are critical for the role."
  },
  "languageProficiency": {
    "score": 0,
    "analysis": "There is a complete language mismatch. The job requires a strong grasp of JavaScript, but all of the candidate's submissions are in Java. The profile provides no evidence of JavaScript proficiency."
  },
  "consistency": {
    "score": 0,
    "analysis": "The profile is inactive, with the last submission recorded in 2015. This lack of recent activity is a major concern, as the demonstrated skills are severely outdated and not representative of current capabilities."
  },
  "finalVerdict": "Not Recommended. The candidate's LeetCode profile indicates a skill level far below the requirements for this role. Key deficiencies include a lack of proficiency in the required programming language (JavaScript), insufficient problem-solving history, a very narrow and basic understanding of DSA, and no recent coding activity. The profile does not align with any of the core job criteria."
