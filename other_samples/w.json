However, there are two significant gaps: 1) A critical mismatch in frontend technology, with the candidate showing experience in React while the role explicitly requires Angular. 2) A lack of demonstrated experience or interest in the job's specific domain of IIoT and time-series data (InfluxDB, Redis, MQTT). While the backend and DevOps skills are a great fit, the candidate does not meet the core frontend or domain-specific requirements for this particular role.",
